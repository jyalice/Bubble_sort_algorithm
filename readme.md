# Bubble sort

## Compare adjacent numbers; if the left one is larger than the right one, exchange their positions. 

## Do this for one time, you will get the largest number on the far right. Repeat this procedure for another time for all of the numbers except the largest number, and then this time you will get the second largest number. Go on repeating doing this, and finally all of the numbers will be ordered from small to large.
